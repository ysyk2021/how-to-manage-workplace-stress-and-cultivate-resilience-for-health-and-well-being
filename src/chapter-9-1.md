* **Mindful Breathing**: Simple mindfulness exercises like mindful breathing can be incorporated into your daily routine. It involves taking slow, deliberate breaths and observing each inhalation and exhalation.

* **Non-Judgmental Awareness**: In mindfulness, you learn to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment. This helps you respond to stressors with greater clarity and equanimity.
